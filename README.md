* The following warnings regarding pagination appear in Gitpod for app.py:

![gitpod-warnings](https://github.com/Sharon-B/Recipe-Box/blob/master/readme-documentation/gitpod-pagination-warnings.png)

As pagination is currently working it was decided to leave these warnings for now.

# Defensive Design

* Users cannot brute force their way onto pages that they donâ€™t have access to eg a not logged in user cannot access the add_recipe page by adding /add_recipe to the url, a flash message will be displayed asking them to log in.
* Only logged in users can access the add recipe page.
* Logged in users can only edit/delete their own recipes.
* Only admin user can access the admin pages.
* 404 error page has being included.
